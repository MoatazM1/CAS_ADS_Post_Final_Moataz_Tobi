# ðŸ“¦ CAS ADS Final Project â€” Swiss Post Package Sorting Optimization

This repository contains the final CAS Advanced Data Science (ADS) project submitted by **Moataz & Tobi**. The project addresses real-world performance challenges in **Swiss Post's package sorting centers**, using predictive and prescriptive modeling techniques.

## ðŸš€ Objective

To detect and prevent **performance degradation** caused by overloaded chutes, by developing and comparing multiple machine learning strategies:

1. ðŸŽ¯ Predicting delays using time series data
2. ðŸ”„ Rerouting ZIP codes dynamically to optimize chute assignments using Reinforcement Learning
3. ðŸ“‰ Reducing processing time through smart intervention strategies
